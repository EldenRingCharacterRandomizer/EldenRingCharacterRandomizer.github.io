From the following list of stat combinations:

âœ¦ { Str: C, Dex: D }
  { Str: B }
  { Str: E, Dex: B }
  { Str: B, Dex: B }
  { Str: C, Dex: E }
  { Str: E, Dex: E, Fai: B }
  { Str: E, Dex: C }
  { Str: E, Dex: E, Fai: B }
  { Str: E, Dex: E, Int: B }
  { Str: C, Dex: D, Int: C }
  { Str: C, Dex: D, Arc: D }
  { Str: C, Dex: D, Arc: D }
  { Str: D, Dex: E, Arc: B }

If the list contains any combinations of more than 3 attributes, split them into each possible combination of 3 from that combination, add them to the list, and then remove any duplicates.

Considering that for each combination of stats, each letter has the following amount of points: {S=30, A=30, B=20, C=15, D=10, E=5}

Knowing this, filter out any of the combinations in the list that contain a total score of less than 30 points. 

Print that list with only the attribute strings having the letters you used to filter removed. For example: {Str}, {Str, Fai}, {Dex, Arc, Str}
